# Gastos (Expenses)

![Gastos](http://arielvila.com/files/repos/gastos_icon2.png) This is an old application (2010) to record daily expenses in a CSV file. To facilitate the entry, two levels of categories (types and subtypes) are used. After selecting the type and subtype, you access to the screens where the rest of the fields in the file gastos.csv are saved (price, discount, date, etc). Each of the text fields keep a history of previously entered values to facilitate replication.

**Technical features**: Own CRUDL Engine that takes the definition of the fields and generates the SQLite table and all the necessary screens (list, editing, viewing and deleting). Integration with Dropbox for data backup.
